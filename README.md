# Mini-URL-Generator
The Mini URL Generator is a simple tool that generates short URLs from long URLs, allowing you to create compact and shareable links.
## How It Works
The Tiny URL Generator uses a combination of encoding and hashing techniques to generate unique and compact short URLs. It follows the following steps:
1. Receive a long URL as input.
2. Generate a unique identifier for the long URL.
3. Encode the identifier into a short string using a specified character set or algorithm.
4. Store the mapping between the short URL and the original long URL.
5. When a user accesses the short URL, redirect them to the original long URL.
